# CalForKids

The goal is to create a simplified calculator, as if it were targeted at younglings.
This application should run on Android devices, phones or tablets, running Android version 7.0 (Nougat) minimum, and follow all guidelines and constraints listed throughout this document.

Main point:
✓ Application name is Calc for kids 
✓ Application is written in Kotlin.
✓ Besides the ones added by the project creation wizard and Android extensions libraries (like
ConstraintLayout), the only external library is Retrofit.
✓ Layouts shown for each screen are to be considered as specifications. Although specific characteristics can
be changed (text color, images...), layout, sizes and proportions must be retained.


Our app is targeted at younglings so it remains very simple. 
• Only 4 basic operators. +, -, x and /
• Positive integers only. Even division returns only integer part.
• Each operand is capped at 9999.

• 3-step how-to:
o First numbers typed go into the first operand
o Then select an operator
o Next digits go into the second operand
o Press the equals button to display the result.
